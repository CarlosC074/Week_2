        <p>My name is Carlos Castano, I have been interested in coding for a long time, especially because of a video game I played as a kid: Warioware DIY. It's a game 
            where you creat microgames: very short minigames that are intended to last for a few second to achieve a basic task. The game 
            allowed players to draw assets, make music, and even code the games with a pretty friendly user interface. My passion for things like coding 
            turned into a side hobby where I would look up free coding courses to learn how to code while going to college for chemical engineering. I believe coding is a very good 
            career to have and maybe fall back on for when I decide to go back to school for chemistry. Coding can be frustrating, but getting stuff to work
            is a wicked good feeling.
